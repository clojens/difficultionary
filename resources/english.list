prosody::
In linguistics, prosody is the rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech.
Prosody may reflect various features of the speaker or the utterance: the
emotional state of the speaker; the form of the utterance (statement, question,
or command); the presence of irony or sarcasm; emphasis, contrast, and focus;
or other elements of language that may not be encoded by grammar or by choice
of vocabulary.

idiosyncrasy::
An idiosyncrasy is an unusual feature or perhaps odd habit. The term is often
used to express eccentricity or peculiarity. A synonym may be "quirk". The term
can also be applied to symbols or words. Idiosyncratic symbols mean one thing
for a particular person, as a blade could mean war, but to someone else, it
could symbolize a surgery. By the same principle, some linguists state that
words are not only arbitrary, but also largely idiosyncratic signs.

idiom::
An idiom is a combination of words that have a figurative meaning owing to its
common usage. An idiom's figurative meaning is separate from the literal
meaning. Idioms occur frequently in all languages on the planet.

complexion::
The general appearance or character of something.

complected::
Complexioned, back formation probably. Finds there’s a controversy over the
words complexioned and complected. Thinks those people have too much time.
Occurs in educated speech and occasionally in edited writing. Found in life
probably only ever used by Clojurans.

unambiguous::
If something is unambiguous, there are no two ways to interpret it. Something
is not open for interpretation: its message and intent, or meaning are clear.
If your girlfriend burns all your letters, texts you that she hates you, and
moves a thousand miles away, the unambiguous message is that she’s finished
with you. The word unambiguous derives its meaning from un-, meaning "not,"
combined with the Latin -ambi-, meaning "both ways," and -agere, meaning "to
drive". So unambiguous is *not driving in two directions* -> **one meaning**.
