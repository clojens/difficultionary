== Predicate

There are two competing notions of the predicate in theories of grammar.

== First notion (traditional)

The first concerns traditional grammar, which tends to view a predicate as:

- one of two main parts of a sentence, the other part being the subject
- the purpose of the predicate is to complete an idea about the subject
  such as what it does or what it is like.

== Second notion (first order logic)

The second derives from work in predicate calculus (predicate logic, first order
logic) and is prominent in modern theories of syntax and grammar.

In this approach, the predicate of a sentence:

- corresponds mainly to the main verb
- and any auxiliaries that accompany the main verb
- the arguments of that predicate are outside the predicate

Arguments are often subject, object and other noun-phrases NP

This article considers both of these notions.
